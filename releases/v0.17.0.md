After his awesome React template last release, [admin_3.exe](https://github.com/bh90210) has come up with the goods again and delivered an Angular 8 template for the Wails community! Thanks admin_3.exe! 👏🎉

We continue to expand our supported platform list with the introduction of Debian support. Versions 9 and 10 tested so far.

## Distribution Support Request Wizard!

</p>

We have added a feature whereby when you try and run `wails init` on an unsupported Linux distribution, it will now prompt you to submit a support request. This will automatically generate a github request with the distribution name, version and discovery method. There is literally nothing more you have to do than click the 'submit' button in the browser window that opens for you. This really helps us to get your distribution supported.
