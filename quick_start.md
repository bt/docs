# Quick Start

To get up and running quickly, do the following:

1. Setup your Wails system by running the [setup command](./reference/cli.md#setup) `wails setup`. 
2. Generate a new project using the [init command](./reference/cli.md#init) `wails init`. Select the default options.
3. Change into the project directory (cd my-project) and compile your application using the [build command](./reference/cli.md#build) `wails build`.
4. If all went well, you should have a compiled program in your local directory. Run it with `./my-project` or double click `myproject.exe` if on windows.

## High Level Overview

Wails applications consist of 2 parts:

  * A backend written in Go
  * A frontend written using standard HTML/JS/CSS

These are compiled and bundled together using the `wails build` command. This will firstly build the frontend project into Javascript and CSS bundles. It will then build the main Go application, which bundles the 2 frontend asset files as part of the application. This produces a single application.

## Frontend

The frontend is a standard Vue/React project that gets compiled down to Javascript and CSS bundles. It lives in the `frontend` directory of the project. There is nothing particularly special about the project other than it is configured to bundle the whole project down to 2 bundles: app.js and app.css.

## Backend

The backend initially comprises of a single main.go file:

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/leaanthony/mewn"
	"github.com/wailsapp/wails"
)

func basic() string {
	return "Hello World!"
}

func main() {

	js := mewn.String("./frontend/dist/app.js")
	css := mewn.String("./frontend/dist/app.css")

	app := wails.CreateApp(&wails.AppConfig{
		Width:  1024,
		Height: 768,
		Title:  "Quotes",
		JS:     js,
		CSS:    css,
		Colour: "#131313",
	})
	app.Bind(basic)
	app.Run()
}
```
Here is a quick explanation of how this works:

| Lines    | Explanation                                                    | 
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| 1        | The standard package directive.                                |
| 3-6      | Imports the Wails framework and the Mewn utility package that we will use for handling assets.                                                            |
| 8-10     | A standard Go function that returns the string "Hello World!". |
| 12       | The main function declaration.                                 |
| 14       | Reads in the frontend javascript bundle as a string.           |
| 15       | Reads in the frontend css bundle as a string.                  |
| 17-24    | Creates a new Wails application, specifying width, height, title and a colour for the application window. We also specify the Javascript and CSS we wish the application to render - the JS/CSS we previously read in on lines 14 & 15.              |
| 25       | Binds our basic function to the application.                   |
| 26       | Runs the application.                                          |

If you make changes to the frontend or backend, you simply have to run `wails build` to regenerate your application.
